Analysis of google playstore data
The Internet is a true gold mine of data. E-commerce and review sites are brimming with a lot of untapped data with a prominent potential to convert into meaningful insights that can help with robust decision making. Here, we explore using data science and machine learning techniques on data retrieved from one such avenue on the internet, the Google Play Store.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109526052/194060139-6d19243c-4315-45a6-8a82-b232425797ac.png)
Details of Dataset:-
The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market. The dataset is chosen from Kaggle. It is the web scraped data of 10k Play Store apps for analyzing the Android market. It consists of in total of 10841 rows and 13 columns.

The columns of the dataset are as follows:
